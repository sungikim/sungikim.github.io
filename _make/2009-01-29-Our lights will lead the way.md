Our lights will lead the way 
\_Eco-friendly Road light for the countryside The special lane lights sense vehicles passing by and get powered with the gust of wind these vehicles produce. Having mini-wind-turbines and wireless data link sensors, the lights caution the others in a row at about 50-100 meters, and the latter start blinking. So, while you take to the road, the peg lights will lead your way and since these ask for nothing to keep illuminating.
